    <p> so I just spent some time figuring out how to create my first GitHub page. I made this without using Jekyll because I figured it would be easier to just get started without setting up a template or whatever. now I have a github page. the jekyll themes us an .yml file. not sure how that works anymore. kind of did long ago. will write up better walkthrough about this later. inclode difficulty in getting page to render. kept getting 404. not 100% sure why but fix was just delete repo and start fresh. always a good solution!.</p>
    <p>...all done on iphone...</p>
    <p>I should figure out how to add a page before finishing up the sesh.</p>
    <p>Although i guess just formatting by post. otherwise I'll prob have to lear jekyll which is what I'll do next</p>
