        <p>I should probably start taking this a bit more seriously. If I'm going to be posting here every day and using it in some professional capacity then I should probably start being a bit less silly... or AI will replace us all and then I can just laugh about it with my immortal robot vocal box. Anyway, let us try to figure out Jekyll.</p>
        <p>...okay so here's my dilemma, I actually really enjoy the basic page &lpar;the one you're reading in this current moment&rpar; I created with just html and css so what I might do is pull my other site which is already using Jekyll &lpar; although the theme doesn't seem to be working for some reason&rpar;. Maybe I'll just scrap that whole repo and start a new project from scratch since there isn't anything in that one anyway. Yeah...</p>
        <h2>A whole other day</h2>
        <p>testing... stuff.</p>
        <p>Still the same day. just enjoying this courier font family I added. Pretty sweeeeet...</p>
        <p>Studying for comptia itf+. Gonna schedule testing for the beginning of next month if not sooner. Material seems pretty standard.</p>
        <p>Still need to get jekyll configured... ratz... oh well, still a good night.</p>
    <h2>Today</h2>
        <p>Decided to see if there is an option for a text editor that can connect to a github and of course there is one. kids these days don't know how how they how how.</p>

    <div class="text-body">
    <h2>Today</h2>
        <p>cant get Jekyll minima theme to work but template is working. Annoyed but gratified.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-body">
    <h2>yesterday</h2>
    <p> so I just spent some time figuring out how to create my first GitHub page. I made this without using Jekyll because I figured it would be easier to just get started without setting up a template or whatever. now I have a github page. the jekyll themes us an .yml file. not sure how that works anymore. kind of did long ago. will write up better walkthrough about this later. inclode difficulty in getting page to render. kept getting 404. not 100% sure why but fix was just delete repo and start fresh. always a good solution!.</p>
    <p>...all done on iphone...</p>
    <p>I should figure out how to add a page before finishing up the sesh.</p>
    <p>Although i guess just formatting by post. otherwise I'll prob have to lear jekyll which is what I'll do next</p>
